# Airy React Components

The Airy React Components has been extracted from the 
[Airy Core Platform](https://github.com/airyhq/airy), wan open source, fully-featured, production ready 
messaging platform to process conversational data from a variety of sources
(like Facebook Messenger, Google Business Messages, Website Live Chat, and
more). For more information about the project, see [https://docs.airy.co](https://docs.airy.co)

Here is a quick introduction to the frontend projects:

- `components`

  Here you can find the [Airy
  Components Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@airyhq/components) library. We are open-sourcing
  (it's a work in progress) the critical components necessary to build a
  messaging application. We use this library to power our commercial offering.

- `showcase`

  This directory contains a small React application that showcases the
  components of the [Airy Components
  Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@airyhq/components), we host the `main`
  branch version at [https://components.airy.co](https://components.airy.co).
